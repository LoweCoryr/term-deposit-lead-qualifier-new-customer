# term-deposit-lead-qualifier-new-customer
An analysis to qualify prospective new customers, to reach out to for offering a high-rate term deposit offering.

Research Aim:
  Find New Customers
      --We can use the information we know about existing customers, to specifically target new customers.
      --We know which variables result in customers purchasing term deposit account.
        --These customers are super-valuable, as term deposits allow the bank to lend out money at higher rates.
      --By being specific, we can do a phone and mail campaign, which is expensive in general, but will be highly-targetted, which will keep costs down, and maximize the response rate.
      --If we use the variables we can purchase from data brokers (i.e. demographics), we could target similar new customers
